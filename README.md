### Introduction

I have analyzed __International Bikes Sales__ Data to help the company improve their sales and revenue. As well I wanted to analyze wether there was a correlation with bike sales and __obesity and CO2 Emisions__ around the world.

### Data Extraction & Analysis

I have used data from different websites such as __Kaggle__ and __Data Worldbank.__
I have used Tableau to analyze the data and draw correlation and conslcusions between the variables.
Power Point was the app to present the findings and interpretations.

### Conclusions

* Road bikes make up the highest amount of profit in the sub-categories.
* __CO2 emissions could decrease__ if more people switch to bike usage, however other factors need to change to effectively decrease emissions.
